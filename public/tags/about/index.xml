      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m William (Billy) Matthias. A PhD student in the Dept. of Government (aka Political Science) at the University of Texas - Austin. I am interested in researching issues related to the political economy of development, conflict, and peace building. I also love (Philadelphia) sports, photography, and film.
This site&amp;rsquo;s purpose is four-fold:
 To hone and synthesize my education and skills related to statistics, data analysis, and visualization.
 (Relatedly) To practice and demonstrate programming that is important for these skills.</description>
