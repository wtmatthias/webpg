I am a PhD student in the Department of Government (aka Political Science) at the University of Texas - Austin. I'm concurrently a Graduate Research Fellow and Task Team Leader at Innovations for Peace and Development, which is an international development research lab based at UT-Austin. I am interested in researching issues related to the political economy of development, conflict, and peace-building. Previous internship work and research has allowed me to work with non-profits and non-governmental organizations in several countries.
