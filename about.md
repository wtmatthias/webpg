<p>I love analyzing data, managing process improvement projects and learning new things. I am Founder/CEO of a data analytics consultancy called 3PM Coffee Break. I've lived all over Southern California in the last 15 years now, loved every minute of it and currently make my home in the greater San Diego area, with my husband.</p>

<p>I grew up in India, in a metropolitan town called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadodara" target="_blank">Baroda</a>. Baroda is best known for its beautiful <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Baroda_Lvp.JPG" target="_blank">royal</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laxmi_Vilas_Palace,_Vadodara" target="_blank">palace</a>, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maharaja_Sayajirao_University_of_Baroda" target="_blank">awesome university</a> and a small-city feel with big city values.</p>

<p>I moved here in my senior year of high school, and except for a year in grad school at <a href="http://illinois.edu/" target="_blank">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>, have happily made my home in various parts of Southern California since.</p>

<p>These days, I'm working full-time (again) for Warner Bros. as a project manager for tech and process improvement initiatives. It's different from what I've done before, and completely awesome so far. I'm learning first hand how to think strategically about organizational change and the level/scope of communication needed to make the change stick.</p>
