I'm William (Billy) Matthias. A PhD student in the Dept. of Government (aka Political Science) at the University of Texas - Austin. I am interested in researching issues related to the political economy of development, conflict, and peace building. I also love (Philadelphia) sports, photography, and film.

This site's purpose is four-fold:

1. To hone and synthesize my education and skills related to statistics, data analysis, and visualization.

2. (Relatedly) To practice and demonstrate programming that is important for these skills. Most of the focus is on R and Python.

3. To take technical, jargon-y findings from exploratory data analyses and put them into a more disgestible form.

4. To help others learn about 1. and 2. and 3.[^1]

I don't come from a traditional computer science background and so I'm self-taught (more precisely...internet and book taught). I want to give back to the online masses that taught me and continue to help me learn. Additionally, I've noticed that a lot of these online communities, blogs, etc. sometimes assume that you know more than you actually do when you're a beginner, or even intermediate programmer. In my blog posts on programming, I hope to bring a balance between spelling things out clearly without going overboard on the nitty gritty details.
