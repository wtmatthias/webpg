      <description>Notes: This article originally appeared in CodeRag.
Code/Rag has always been more than just another online tech blog. We strive to be part of the tech community—serving an essential, fundamental look at what’s going on in the valley. It’s why our tagline is “Know Your Code.” We think a tech news publication should know the basics. Be the source. Get down to brass tacks. We can do that because we’re part of the very ecosystem we’re reporting on.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m William (Billy) Matthias. A PhD student in the Dept. of Government (aka Political Science) at the University of Texas - Austin. I am interested in researching issues related to the political economy of development, conflict, and peace building. I also love (Philadelphia) sports, photography, and film.
This site&amp;rsquo;s purpose is four-fold:
 To hone and synthesize my education and skills related to statistics, data analysis, and visualization.
 (Relatedly) To practice and demonstrate programming that is important for these skills.</description>
